### Known bugs / minor issues to fix

  ...

> To keep the code clean, readable and easy to debug we employ some of the `c++` best practices described in details in [the following online manual](https://www.learncpp.com/). Basically, if there is any ambiguity on how to implement something, it's a good start to first look if there is any "best practice" solution offered in that manual.

### Unit testing

A limited number of unit tests are now available. To compile/run them:
```shell
cmake -B build -D TESTS=ON
cd build
make -j
cd tests && ctest -j
```

Tests are automatically run when on pull requests to the `master` branch.

## Third-party libraries

1. [`Kokkos`](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/): for CPU/GPU portability
2. [`adios2`](https://github.com/ornladios/ADIOS2): for output

## Dependencies

While we try to keep the code as compatible as possible, there are certain stringent requirements we impose.

1. `cmake>=3.16`: for configuration (verify: `cmake --version`);
2. `icx>=19.1` or `gcc>=8.3.1` with `c++17` support (verify: `[icx|gcc] -std=c++17 -v`; optionally `nvcc` compilers: `nvcc --version`).

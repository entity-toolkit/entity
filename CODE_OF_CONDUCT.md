This code of conduct outlines shared principles and expectations for all participants in our open-source project. It's here to keep things open, respectful, and simple for everyone. Anyone involved with using and developing the code are expected to follow these guidelines starting from the release version `1.2.0`.

# Open-source Principles
- This project is fully open-source and does not belong to any individual or institution. 
- It is developed and maintained by our team of incredibly talented people, whose goal is to make it accessible to everyone with no expectation of credits.
- Anyone is free to use, copy, modify, or distribute the code under the project's open license.
- If you contribute something to the repository, it becomes part of the project and thus will also be regarded as open-source.

# Contributions and Credit
- The only attribution we strongly encourage is a citation of either the code repository, or the corresponding method papers (coming soon).
- All contributions are made voluntarily, and there is no expectation of recognition of isolated individuals.
- There's no built-in expectation of credit or authorship for modules or changes pushed to the repository. Anyone is free to use any part of the code with no attribution to the author of any specific module or algorithm. 
- The code is there for everyone to use, and its only goal is to enable the community to produce exciting science!

# Roles in the Project
- There are three informal roles:
  - users: anyone using the code;
  - contributors: users who have write access to the repository;
  - maintainers: contributors who also take care of organizational, administrative, and tech-support duties.
- Role changes (user -> contributor or vice versa) are easy and open, and can be done by asking the maintainers.
- Contributors are also expected to follow any shared guidelines -- whether discussed informally or written down -- around code-development things, such as committing, merging, and creating pull requests.
- Maintainers have the most strict obligations of keeping the repository clean, managing pull-requests, issuing releases, documenting all the features and additions, writing unit tests, helping other users and contributors with any problems they encounter, etc.
- To reiterate, regardless of the extent of involvement and help, there is absolutely no expectation of recognition or attribution on maintainers' end! 

# Community and Participation
- Everyone is welcome in the community.
- Joining meetings on Zoom, using the Slack workspace, giving feedback, taking part in decision making and planning, or following development doesn't require any special status -- it's open to all.

Finally, while we cannot enforce it, we strongly encourage any projects that build on this code to be open source too. If you build upon this project, we welcome transparency and openness in spirit. You may contribute to the code as much or as little as you like; all effort is appreciated, none is required.
